        I am a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>, using
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and
        <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> to make web sites and apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm comfortable using JS frameworks (Angular, React, Vue, Svelte) or
        writing from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a certified AWS developer, with experience in using a wide range of
        AWS products.

            In February 2024 I was given the opportunity to work at
            <a href="https://www.hedgehoglab.com/">hedgehog lab</a>, a
            human-centred tech consultancy with the cutest logo
            <img src="img/hhl_character.webp" width="38" height="32" />.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm getting the chance to upskill in so many areas - working in Vue,
            React and more, and I'm also getting to work with some of the best
            people in the industry. I'm really looking forward to this next
            phase in my career!

            Looking for a new challenge to expand my horizons, in April 2023 I
            moved to <a href="https://www.bjss.com/">BJSS</a>, a tech
            consultancy.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a fantastic place to work, with some super-talented folk
            working there. However, by early 2024 I was given an opportunity to
            take on a role with more seniority and the chance to have a direct
            impact in more projects, so it was time for me to move on.

            After four years at the University of York I decided it was time for
            a new challenge. Enter
            <a href="https://www.cloudgateway.co.uk/">Cloud Gateway</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I joined the company when it was 18 months old, a small startup with
            a bright future. By the time I left it was nearing 50 employees, and
            the development team had grown to four people.
          </p>
          <p>
            I redeveloped the customer portal, where customers can log on to see
            details of their accounts. This meant diving into Angular and AWS
            services, which was a new tech stack for me, and I learned so much.

            I worked at the

            2015 to May 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
            The higher education sector hasn't always been the most up-to-date
            when it comes to their websites, but in my years at York I was proud
            to be part of, and then lead, a quick-moving digital marketing team.
          </p>
          <p>
            We built and developed a responsive framework to deliver a new and
            improved digital experience for students, alumni and staff.

            Working at
            <a href="http://www.epiphanysearch.co.uk">Epiphany</a> allowed me to
            flourish, rising from being the single developer in a team of two to
            be a senior developer in a team of over 20.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started there in August 2010 along with
            <a href="http://iamgaz.co.uk/">Gaz Battersby</a>, as a new team
            dedicated to creating cool interactive pieces. It seemed to work
            pretty well, and the team grew.
          </p>
          <p>
            A great place to work, with a brilliant culture and outstanding
            people. But new challenges awaited at York!

            One of Leeds' first digital agencies, which set my career rising.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I was there for less than a year, working at Sense put me
            in touch with the Leeds agency scene, and allowed me to make
            contacts that have lasted to this day.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was bitterly sad when it closed its doors, but Epiphany was there
            to catch a couple of ex-Sense employees to lead their new R &amp; D
            team.

          <p>
            I'm no salesman, and running my own business proved that to me. I'm
            proud of the work I did there, and learned a lot of valuable
            lessons, but I was never going to be able to bring in the business I
            needed to stay afloat.

          <p>
            It was during this time that my career path started veering towards
            front-end development. Until then, web developers tended to do a
            little bit of front-end, a bit of back-end, some copywriting and
            even sysadmin when it was needed. But the digital world was growing
            and I needed to specialise.

            <strong>Mastodon</strong> is more work-related. Since Twitter
            imploded in 2023 I've not used it at all, and Mastodon seems to be
            the place where a lot of the tech scene have relocated.
